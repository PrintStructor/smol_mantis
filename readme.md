### Features
* Split mgn12 carriage to faciliate belt installation
* mgn12 carriage has integrated umbilical/zipchain anchor
* integrated klickyNG carriage for both mgn9 and mgn12
* SB leds support 
* Removable 4010 fan ducts with large outlets. Should be easy to design and make ducts improvements


### Compatibility
* Toolhead has the same mounting pattern as the stock mantis, and should work with other mantis carriage variants for other probe needs
* KlickyNG is not compatible with original Klicky probes. KlickyNG/unklickyNG probes are much easier to build.
* Dragon SF/HF hotend
* Homemade or bought sherpa mini extruder

### Credits
* 4010 fan shroud was based on [Minsket's](https://github.com/Minsekt/moronvods/tree/main/Dual_4010_SB_LEDS), but the fan duct has been redesigned for airflow/rigidity/upgradability
